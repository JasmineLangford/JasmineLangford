I'm a former mergers and acquisitions project manager who is currently completing a degree in software development. With my diverse background in project management and growing technical expertise, I am eager to transition into tech either as an IT Project Manager or Software Developer.

My experience in M&A has equipped me with essential skills such as adaptability, clear communication, and a results-driven mindset, all of which have prepared me well for a career in software development. As a curious student, I actively seek opportunities to expand my skill set and knowledge of the industry by exploring different technologies and tools. I am particularly interested in creating applications that prioritize user experience and strive to stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and best practices.

When I am not coding, you can find me watching scary movies, baking, or playing dinosaurs with my kiddos.
