I'm a former mergers and acquisitions project manager who is currently completing a degree in software development. With my diverse background in project management and growing technical expertise, I am eager to transition into a role as an IT Project Manager.

My experience in M&A has equipped me with essential skills such as adaptability, clear communication, and a results-driven mindset, all of which have prepared me well for a career in project management. I am excited to bring these skills to the tech industry and apply them to the fast-paced world of software development.

As I complete my degree, I am exploring various technologies and tools to expand my skill set and enhance my knowledge of the industry. I am particularly interested in creating applications that prioritize user experience and strive to stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and best practices. My goal as an IT Project Manager is to lead cross-functional teams in creating innovative solutions that drive business success.

When I'm not coding, you can find me watching scary movies, baking, or playing dinosaurs with my kiddos.
